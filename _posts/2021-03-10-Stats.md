First of all, happy New Year! Let's hope it's less of a shitshow this time... <br><br>
Now, onto the main topic: Curseforge is the main website for obtaining Minecraft mods (for now... but that's a story for another time). <br><br>
Recently, TheGlitch76 made a [very useful gist](https://gist.github.com/TheGlitch76/779100730cc0a37130966cf50c4514dc), which contains statistics generated by an automatic tool, detailing the proportions of mods on the platform and the technologies they use. <br>

I inputted it all into Excel, made some graphs, and here is the result: <br><br>

As you can see, Forge has a fairly decent majority of mods on 1.16.4, although Fabric has a distinct standing, one which is larger than it was on 1.15.2 (you can see the 1.15.2 data at the link at the bottom of this post).<br>
This is good for modders and players alike, as Fabric is generally faster, and easier for most use cases. Something else which is unsurprising is that most Fabric mods are using Mixins (this is due to the intentionally sparse API) and almost no Forge mods are using Mixins _or_ coremods. <br>
I presume this to be for two reasons: firstly, Forge's API is _huge_, and so Mixins are not required as often. Secondly, the Forge team and Discord server frequently rubbishes Mixins, mainly for reason one but also for other technical reasons. <br><br>
I'll look more in-depth into this data in the future, but for now if you want to analyse it yourself you can do so at: <br>
