title: \'Forge-remarks\' and the current modded situation.
---

*Note: Do NOT go and send hate to anyone mentioned here (or myself for that matter :P), this is just a recap of what happened and my personal opinion. Don't be an idiot.* <br> <br>

It's now been three months since the last revision of "forge-remarks", a [gist made by JellySquid](https://gist.github.com/jellysquid3/8b68b81a5e48462f8690284a0a3c89a1), developer of the well-known Phosphor, Lithium and Sodium mods, in which she details her reasoning for dropping support for the Forge modloader. If those past two sentences don't make any sense, this post won't be of any use to you. If you do, read on for my reflections on the points she details, 3 months after the events took place, as well as a general view of the modded community today.<br><br>

## Forge Developers' Comments

Comments like this were a staple of the Forge discord (and Jelly's comment sections, mind you), with people being somewhat skeptical towards the mods. This is normal at first, as we've all seen "fPs b00st!!!1!!1!" mods far too many times which do absolutely nothing, and in fact Jelly's mods led to one person making such a mod (but that's a story for another time). <br> However, some people just made simply false claims about the mod and the way it functions. This is all background information, by the way. Most of these claims have since been debunked but this culminated in one specific comment from the lead Forge dev, LexManos: <br> <br>

The problematic nature of this is clear, and unsurprisingly the Forge community has a bit of a reputation for being a bit... unwelcoming at times. Three months later, this unfortunately doesn't seem to have changed, and it's not unlikely for `#wtforge`, a channel in the MCDrama server, to fill up with such depressing sights of unpleasantness from some community members. <br>

## JellySquid's Mods Today
At this time, the Jelly Suite was a relatively new thing which wasn't used that much, with Optifine being preferred. However, a quick change was observed in an unexpected field: speedrunning. Suddenly, the speedrunning community began unequivocally using the Jelly Suite to improve performance, and some of the top runs have a little note next to them saying `JellySquid`, and the rules now specifically dictate that Optifine cannot be used above 1.16, and that only JellySquid mods can be used. Nowadays, Lithium also finds itself on major SMP servers, such as the famous Hermitcraft SMP, where YouTubers from around the world come together to play Minecraft. <br><br>

## A Warning.
What does this have to do with anything, you may ask? Well, it's pretty clear that the Forge community was jumping to conclusions and, in some cases, being rather hostile at points, and while I do not wish to make generalisations, this problem is very prevalent for some of the more active members of the community. There's not much anyone can do about this, except the Forge community themselves. They just need to be more mindful that other people use different loaders and different versions and different APIs, and that's OK. It's their choice after all.
