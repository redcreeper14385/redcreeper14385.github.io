Is this thing on? It is? OK, good. <br> <br>
**Hello there!** My name (well, my *digital* name) is mounderfod, 
I'm from the United Kingdom but I also speak fluent French (I've heard far too many baguette jokes, they're just not funny anymore).
I decided to make this blog because I wanted a place to just spill my opinions into an empty void, where no one will see my crappy takes. Wait... <br>
If you're here, then that means I've failed to do that. Damn it! <br>
Ehh, whatever, now that you've made it through this rambling you can go and enjoy a lot more rambling.
