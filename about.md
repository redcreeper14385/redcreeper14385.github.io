My name (well, my digital name) is mounderfod, I’m from the United Kingdom but I also speak fluent French (I’ve heard far too many baguette jokes, they’re just not funny anymore). I decided to make this blog because I wanted a place to just spill my opinions into an empty void, where no one will see my crappy takes.
